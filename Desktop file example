Just an example of a desktop file to create a clickable icon on gnome if you want
replace $USER with your actual username and rename the image to whatever image you pick
this is based around my own weird idea of where to put things, so adjust as needed
create this file and name it notes.desktop and place it in ~/.local/share/applications then logout and back in
